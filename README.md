# Maze

This project implements a functional, immutable version of the Recursive Backtracking
[maze generation](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking) algorithm and uses [quil](http://www.quil.info/) to draw it.

It's a pet project! Although this implementation uses tail recursion (differently from the original) and is not limited by the stack size, you probably will not find here the faster or most optimized solution.
